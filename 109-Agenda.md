# DRAFT Agenda for IETF-109 BoF - MADINAS
MAC Address Device Identification for Network and Application Services

2 Hours

## Welcome & Agenda Review (BoF Chair)
- Juan Carlos Zuniga <j.c.zuniga@ieee.org>


## Background -- 30 Mins
- Short history/status about the work in IEEE 802 & WBA - Amelia Andersdotter, CENTR
- How operating systems implement today - Apple / iOS - TBD
- How operating systems implement today - Google / Android - TBD

## Use Cases
### Home Network Use Cases -- 40 Mins
- Use case for diagonstic and customer support (Simon Ringland, BT)
- Use case for Wi-Fi band and AP steering (Simon Ringland, BT)
- Use case to setup a server at home - (Yiu Lee, Comcast)
- Use case to protect DDoS mitigation - (Mohamed Boucadair, Orange) - https://github.com/boucadair/IETF109BoF/blob/master/madinas-ddos%20mitigation-use%20case-rev%2027102020.pdf
- Use case for access controls / parental controls - (Charter)
- Use case for service policy based on device identity (Plume)

### Community Wi-Fi and Hospitality Use Cases -- 15 Mins
- Use case for auto-authentication for Open SSID (Comcast, Rajat)
- Use case for UE mobility in Wi-Fi (Ajay, Benu Networks)
- Use case for DHCP Table Exhaustion (ComScope, Eli)

### Cloud Management -- 5 Mins
- Use case for resource management when mac-address is randomized (Plume)

## Discussion, Interest & Next Steps -- 30 Mins (BoF Chair w/AD Support)
- Questions:
  -- What other SSOs are working on this topic or related topics & how to best coordinate?
  -- Are there other communities of interest to be involved?
- Potential Actions:
  -- Document all major use cases currently deployed?
  -- Define best practices for enabling service continuity in the presence of MAC Address randomization?
  -- Define a method for network and application service continuity in the presence of MAC Address randomization?
  -- Determine whether/how/when the host OS may cooperate with the network?
  -- Identify better long term methods to enable network and applications services (alternatives to MAC addresses)?
 - Next Steps
